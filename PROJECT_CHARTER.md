# Renovus SolaREC â€“ Project Charter

## Indroduction
SolaREC is an online platform that can connect to a massive number of small solar generators. This platform can allow users to accurately measure the energy generated; alert when there are problems or errors in generation (4% of solar energy is lost due to technical problems, many of which go undetected or are detected too late); and generate Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) for the user.

## Objectives
The platform can aggregate the RECs of small generators and connect with buyers (corporations, other platforms focused on the purchase of RECs) to sell them, achieving for small generators affiliated to SolaREC a new source of income. This new income can help drive the installation of more distributed/small solar generators in developing countries.

## Scope Definition
SolaREC includes a database, a back-end and front-end, all of it cloud-based. The back-end connects to small solar generators as well as external data sources (for example for climate data); and also connects to platforms that can issue the Renewable Energy Certificates.

## Stakeholder Analysis
Stakeholders for SolaREC include small solar generators (associated with commercial, industrial, educational, residential, rural, and other users) as well as corporations which buy Renewable Energy Certificates.

## Deliverables
Database, back-end and front-end.

## Schedule
Development of SolaREC began in early 2023, though the product is an offshoot of another product developed by Renovus, called Renovus Plus, focused on large wind and solar installations. The initial version of SolaREC is already operational, with a second development stage to add further features until October 2024, and a third development stage from November 2024 until March 2025.

## Resources
The main resource necessary for executing the development of SolaREC includes the team of Renovus developers working on the solution, as well as cloud computing necessary to run the solution.

## Constraints
As with any solution that targets a mass audience, success can depend on reaching stakeholders effectively with limited resources (for example for communications budget).

## Communication Plan
The Renovus team is currently reaching out to small solar generators as well as corporations interested in connecting to SolaREC, for potential sales of RECs as well as purchase of RECs (respectively). The communications plan will then include participation in online events, trade fairs and other instances where potential solar generators or corporations can be reached.
