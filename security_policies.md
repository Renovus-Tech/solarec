## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in any of Renovus Solarec repositories / codes, please follow these guidelines to report it to the project team responsibly.

### Reporting Confidentially

Please do not disclose security-related issues publicly. Instead, report them directly to our security team by emailing admin@renovus.tech. This allows us to assess, respond, and coordinate the necessary fixes before potential attackers become aware.

1. Provide a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce (if applicable).
2. Include any proof-of-concept or exploit code.
3. Do not share the details of the issue publicly until we've had a chance to assess and address it.

## Security Response Team

Our security response team is committed to addressing security issues promptly. They will acknowledge your report, investigate the issue, and work towards a resolution.

## Acknowledgments
